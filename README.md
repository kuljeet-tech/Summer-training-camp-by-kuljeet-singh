##In this repository i will share my experience of summer training camp at gndec,ludhiana
# Day 1
##On the first day of our summer training there was an orientation program where we were introduced to our core department (CSE) and we were told about our syllabus.
After the orientation program we proceed to our respective labs according to our group.In the lab, we were introduced to the Linux operating system by our lab professor (ma'am). She explained the basics of Linux, its history, and why it is widely used in the fields of programming, networking, and system administration.

We learned that Linux is a free, open-source operating system known for its security, stability, and performance. The professor discussed the advantages of Linux over other operating systems and its importance in real-world applications like servers, cloud computing, and software development.

As part of our practical learning, the professor instructed us to install a Linux ( Ubuntu ) on our laptops or lab computers. She guided us through the basic steps to install the Linux using virtual machine.
