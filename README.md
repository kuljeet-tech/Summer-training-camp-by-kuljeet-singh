In this repository i will share my experience of summer training camp at gndec,ludhiana
# Day 1
On the first day of our summer training there was an orientation program where we were introduced to our core department (CSE) and we were told about our syllabus.
After the orientation program we proceed to our respective labs according to our group.In the lab, we were introduced to the Linux operating system by our lab professor (ma'am). She explained the basics of Linux, its history, and why it is widely used in the fields of programming, networking, and system administration.

We learned that Linux is a free, open-source operating system known for its security, stability, and performance. The professor discussed the advantages of Linux over other operating systems and its importance in real-world applications like servers, cloud computing, and software development.

As part of our practical learning, the professor instructed us to install a Linux ( Ubuntu ) on our laptops or lab computers. She guided us through the basic steps to install the Linux using virtual machine.
# Day 2
On the second day of our summer training, our lab professor introduced us to fundamental concepts of Linux including the booting process,kernel and the shell. The session was highly informative and was conducted using a visual presentation, which greatly enhanced our understanding of the topics.
#The session began with an explanation of the booting process, which is the sequence of events that occurs from powering on the computer to getting the operating system ready for use.Booting is of two types 
Cold booting- it refers to the process of starting the computer from completely powered-off state.
Warm booting- it refers to the restarting of computer while its already powered on ,without cutting off the power supply.  
#The kernel was described as the core component of the operating system that manages hardware resources and allows communication between hardware and software.
    Our professor explained how the kernel loads into memory during boot and starts necessary system processes.
#The shell was introduced as a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.
    We discussed different types of shells, with a focus on the **Bash shell**, which is most commonly used in Linux.
  All these things were explained with the help of suitable examples so that they were easy to understand for us. 
#Our professor demonstrated the use of several basic Linux commands. These included:

     1.`ls` – to list directory contents
     2.`pwd` – to display the current working directory
     3.`date` – to show the current system date and time
     4.`mkdir` – to create new directories
     5.`cat` – to display the contents of files
     6.`touch` – to create new empty files
     7.`cp` – to copy files and directories
     8.`cd` – to change the current directory
   * Each command was explained clearly with practical examples shown in the presentation to ensure everyone could follow along visually and conceptually.
